# Digital Road Tax - Officer App

This project is a collaborative work with my coursemate.

Digital Road Tax was proposed to digitalize the Malaysian Road Tax system by replacing Road Tax sticker with a Digital Proof.

The Officer App main objective is to allow for traffic authorities officer to validate the vehicle's road tax and retrieve the vehicle information.

The app has 3 main features:
* Scan digital proof(QR).
* Retrieve vehicle info via License Plate Recognition.
* Operation - Connects 2 or more officers to view same validation results.
